## Executive Summary

GitHub Issues Viewer is a modern Rails 8.1.0 application that provides a GitHub.com-quality interface for viewing and managing issues from multiple GitHub repositories. The application supports both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise, with smart hybrid caching, per-user GitHub token authentication, and dual search modes (local and API-based). Users can track multiple repositories, view issues with full metadata (labels, assignees, comments), and enjoy fast performance through intelligent on-demand caching with graceful degradation.

3. **Smart Performance** - Balance freshness and speed through hybrid caching with on-demand fetching
4. **Enterprise Support** - Work with both GitHub.com and self-hosted GitHub Enterprise servers
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Continue functioning with stale data when API limits or errors occur

- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

#### GitHub Token Configuration
- **Encrypted token storage** - GitHub personal access tokens stored with Rails encrypted attributes
- **Domain configuration** - Support for github.com and custom GitHub Enterprise domains
- **Token validation** - Test GitHub API connection when saving token
- **Per-user tokens** - Each user uses their own GitHub credentials for API access

### 2. Multi-Repository Tracking

#### Repository Import
- **URL-based import** - Parse GitHub URLs in various formats (e.g., https://github.com/owner/repo)
- **Owner/repo extraction** - Intelligent parsing of repository identifiers
- **Validation** - Verify repository exists and user has access via their GitHub token

#### Repository Management
- **Repository list** - View all tracked repositories with metadata
- **Repository metadata** - Name, description, URL, issue counts, last sync time
- **Remove repositories** - Delete repositories from tracking
- **Per-user isolation** - Each user maintains their own repository list

### 3. Issue Viewing with Full Metadata

#### Issue List View (GitHub.com Clone)

### 4. Smart Hybrid Caching

#### Caching Strategy
- **On-demand fetching** - Fetch from GitHub API only when cache is cold (no data)
- **Per-user cache keying** - Each user maintains separate caches (user_id + repository_id)
- **No background jobs** - All syncing happens in-request, no automated background polling
- **SQLite storage** - Cache stored in primary database with timestamps

#### Staleness Management
- **Timestamp tracking** - Record `cached_at` for all synced data
- **Staleness indicators** - Show users how old their cached data is
- **Manual refresh** - "Refresh" button to force sync from GitHub API
- **Visual feedback** - Clear indicators when viewing stale data

#### Graceful Degradation
- **Error handling** - Catch API errors (rate limits, invalid tokens, network issues)
- **Stale data fallback** - Display cached data with prominent warnings when API fails
- **Error banners** - Explain why data might be stale (e.g., "Rate limit reached, showing cached data from 2 hours ago")
- **Retry options** - Allow users to retry once rate limits reset

### 5. Dual Search Modes

#### Local SQLite Search
- **Fast performance** - No API calls, instant results
- **Full-text search** - Search issue titles and bodies
- **Limited scope** - Only searches cached data
- **Filter support** - Combine with state, label, assignee filters

#### GitHub API Search
- **Comprehensive results** - Use GitHub's powerful search API
- **Always fresh** - Real-time results from GitHub
- **Advanced queries** - Leverage GitHub's search syntax
- **Rate limit aware** - Count against user's API limits

#### Search UI
- **Toggle control** - Easy switch between local and API search modes
- **Search preference persistence** - Remember user's preferred search mode
- **Filter combination** - Apply filters (state, labels, assignees) to both modes
- **Sort options** - Sort by created, updated, comments, etc.

- Retry settings (max 3 retries, exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- Default delays between calls (0.1s)
- Pagination sizes (100 items per page)

#### ApiClient
GitHub REST and GraphQL API client:
- Per-user Octokit client initialization (token + domain)
- Rate limit tracking and enforcement
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Graceful error handling (return errors, don't raise)
- Request logging and monitoring
- GraphQL query support for assignable users with pagination
- Unified error handling for both REST and GraphQL endpoints

#### RepositorySyncService
Repository metadata sync:
- Fetch repository details from GitHub API
- Upsert repository record with metadata
- Update issue counts and cached_at timestamp
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Return sync status (success/error)

#### IssueSyncService
Issue sync with full metadata:
- Fetch issues from GitHub API (with pagination)
- Include labels, assignees, comment counts
- Fetch and store all comments for each issue
- Batch upsert for performance
